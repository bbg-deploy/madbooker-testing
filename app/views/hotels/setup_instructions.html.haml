        Step 1
      Create a Button or Link
    You must pick a button or link to put on your website. This link will send your website visitors into your madbooker booking engine.
    
    #link_builder
      What would you like your button/link to say?
      = select_tag "", options_for_select(["Book Your Room", 'Book Your Nights', "Make a Reservation", 'Reserve Your Room']), :id => "link_text"
      
      How would you like your button to look?
      = select_tag "", options_for_select(["Link", "Grey button", "Green button", "Blue button"]), :id => :link_look
      = hidden_field_tag "", current_hotel.booking_url, id: "booking_url"
    
    
      .code_box
        .copy
          Here's what your button/lik will look like.
        #example
          = link_to 'Book Your Room', current_hotel.booking_url, :target=>'_blank'
        .copy
          Here's the code you'll need to add to your website.
        %textarea#example_text
          = link_to 'Book Your Room', current_hotel.booking_url, :target=>'_blank'
    

    %h2
      %span
        Step 2
      Add your button/link to you website
    Take the code from Step 1 and insert it into your website.
      
      
    %h2
      %span
        Step 3
      Publish Your Updated Website

      %span
        Step 4
      Ensure that crossÂ­domain tracking is configured in Google Analytics.
    Note, this step may be ommited if you're not using Google Analytics integration.
    Add this snippet to the page with the link/button above:
    If you're using #{Hotel::GA_UNIVERSAL_ANALYTICS}:
    %pre
      %code
        :escaped
          <script>
            ga('require', 'linker');
            ga('linker:autoLink', "#{App.ga_root_domain}");
          </script>
    If you're using #{Hotel::GA_CLASSIC_ASYNCHRONOUS}:
    Add the following snippet to the button/link snippet above.
    This is what needs to be added:
    %pre
      %code
        :escaped
          _gaq.push(['_link', "#{current_hotel.host}"])
    So this:
    %pre
      %code
        :escaped
          <a href="#{current_hotel.booking_url}" target="_blank">Book Your Room</a>
    becomes this:
    %pre
      %code
        :escaped
          <a href="#{current_hotel.booking_url}" onclick="_gaq.push(['_link', "#{current_hotel.host}"])" target="_blank">Book Your Room</a>
    %h2
