        .what
          %i.icon-long-arrow-left
          Preview

      .clear
      #use_this_code  
        .what
          Copy & Paste
        .copy

        %textarea#example_text
          = link_to 'Book Your Room', current_hotel.booking_url, :target=>'_blank'
    

    %h2
      %span
        Step 2

    %h2
      %span

        Step 4
      Ensure that crossÂ­domain tracking is configured in Google Analytics.
    Note, this step may be ommited if you're not using Google Analytics integration.
    Add this snippet to the page with the link/button above:
    If you're using #{Hotel::GA_UNIVERSAL_ANALYTICS}:
    %pre
      %code
        :escaped
          <script>
            ga('require', 'linker');
            ga('linker:autoLink', "#{App.ga_root_domain}");
          </script>
    If you're using #{Hotel::GA_CLASSIC_ASYNCHRONOUS}:
    Add the following snippet to the button/link snippet above.
    This is what needs to be added:
    %pre
      %code
        :escaped
          _gaq.push(['_link', "#{current_hotel.host}"])
    So this:
    %pre
      %code
        :escaped
          <a href="#{current_hotel.booking_url}" target="_blank">Book Your Room</a>
    becomes this:
    %pre
      %code
        :escaped
          <a href="#{current_hotel.booking_url}" onclick="_gaq.push(['_link', "#{current_hotel.host}"])" target="_blank">Book Your Room</a>
    %h2
